# Boilerplates

This is a very simple Boilerplate application, this has following features.

  - User can Sign In and Up
  - After signing in he can see a list of items
  
It was developed as a demo project before developing production application. I wrote a [blog](https://www.sadmansamee.blog/why_embrace_flutter/) about why we wil be using Futter for our project, visit [here](https://www.sadmansamee.blog/why_embrace_flutter/)
  

#### I didn't add many functionality and didn't polish UI intentionally, tried to keep it barebone as much as possible 

For development flavor, run

``
flutter run -t lib/main_development.dart
``

For staging flavor, run

``
flutter run -t lib/main_staging.dart
``

For production flavor, run

``
flutter run -t lib/main_production.dart
``

For localization better install this [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13666-flutter-intl)
